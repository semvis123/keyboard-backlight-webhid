## How to use
1. Open the web page in a browser that supports WebHID (e.g. Chrome)
2. Click the "Connect" button, and select the keyboard backlight.
3. Use the slider to adjust the backlight brightness

Note: keyboard backlight setting seems to persist in standby mode, so to avoid battery drain, you need to manually turn it off.
